# Preparation for Qiskit

## Things to install

Each participant should bring a laptop with the following installed:

### Required

- Python 3.5 or later, for example as instructed at https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Jupyter notebook software, for example as instructed at https://jupyter.org/install
- Qiskit, as instructed at https://qiskit.org/terra
- Qiskit Aqua, as instructed at https://qiskit.org/aqua

### Optional

- It is often easiest to write programs using an IDE (integrated development environment). PyCharm is an example of one that's good for Python. Installation instructions at https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download
- For those who want to make interactive applications including games, install Pygame. Installation instructions at https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

## Things to learn

You'll need a basic understanding of quantum computing with Qiskit. Please work through the Learning Qiskit guide at [learnqiskit.org](http://learnqiskit.org) up to and including the *Entangling qubits with a CNOT gate* Jupyter notebook.

Make sure you know about the following topics. If you need to brush up, you can use the linked materials.

- Learn about basic quantum gates: (see [here](https://ibm.biz/hello-qiskit) or [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/terra/summary_of_quantum_operations.ipynb))
- Learn about basic quantum circuits: (see [here](https://learnqiskit.gitbook.io/composerguide/getting-started-with-the-composer/chapter-1-the-atoms-of-computation) or [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/terra/quantum_circuits.ipynb))
- [Creating and running circuits with Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/community/hello_world/README.md)
